\section{Introduction}

This report will document the creation of our group's robot for the System Design Project and evaluate the effectiveness and success of our methods. 
The aim of the project was to create a robot which could compete in a one-on-one football match against another robot. This report will explain how we organised our group, built the robot, implemented strategies to control the robot, implemented a vision solution to percept environment, and implemented a simulator..

Our aims for the project were to create a fast, lightweight robot alongside a effective planning algorithm to control it. Next to this, we also required:
\begin{itemize}
\item A vision system to convey the on-pitch data.
\item A simulator for use in testing strategies.
\end{itemize}
