\section{Introduction}

This report will document the creation of our groupâ€™s robot for the System Design Project and evaluate the effectiveness and success of our methods. 
The aim of the project was to create a robot which could compete in a one-on-one football match against another robot. This report will explain how we organised our group, how we built the robot, the strategy we created to control the robot, how a vision system was implemented, and the implementation of a simulator.

Our aims for the project were to create a fast, lightweight robot alongside a effective planning algorithm to control it. Next to this, we also required:
- A vision system to convey the on-pitch data
- A simulator for use in testing strategies
