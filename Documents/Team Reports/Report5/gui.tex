\section{GUI}

To make things easy to control, a GUI was created which had all the controls needed – choosing strategies, executors (Bluetooth or simulator), goal to attack, colour of the plate, pausing/resuming robot movements etc. What is more, after the simulator was developed it‘s frame of pitch visualisation was integrated to whole system to also visualise real pitch. \linebreak

This development made it easier to calibrate various parameters and also to see what state is stored inside computer. For example for some of the strategies we had visualisation of points we want to move to or boundaries we want to avoid, which proved to be very useful to improve strategies.
