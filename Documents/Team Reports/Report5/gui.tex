\section{GUI}

To make our robot easy to control, a GUI was created which had all the options needed – choosing strategies, executors (Bluetooth or simulator), goal to attack, colour of the plate, pausing/resuming robot movements etc. Further more, after the simulator was developed it‘s frame was integrated into the system to also visualise real pitch. \linebreak

This development made it easier to calibrate various parameters and also to see what state the system is in. For example for some of the strategies we had visualisation of points we want to move to or boundaries we want to avoid, which proved to be very useful to improve strategies.
