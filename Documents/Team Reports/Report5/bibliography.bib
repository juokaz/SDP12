  abstract = {Two-dimensional image moments with respect to Zernike polynomials
	are defined, and it is shown how to construct an arbitrarily large
	number of independent, algebraic combinations of Zernike moments
	that are invariant to image translation, orientation, and size. This
	approach is contrasted with the usual method of moments. The general
	problem of two-dimensional pattern recognition and three-dimensional
	object recognition is discussed within this framework. A unique reconstruction
	of an image in either real space or Fourier space is given in terms
	of a finite number of moments. Examples of applications of the method
	are given. A coding scheme for image storage and retrieval is discussed.},
