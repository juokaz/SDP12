\section{Conclusion}

Throughout this project the goal was to build a fast, lightweight robot that could compete well against other robots. Through the construction we managed to make the robot fast through the use of gears, and lightweight by carefully designing the chassis and constantly optimising its design. The strategy utilised this speed and agility well, especially with the use of the Potential Fields algorithm, which gave our robot a quick and smooth movement technique.
